# Windows-Application-Sudoku-Game-with-UI-using-C#

In this project, we use C# to create a Sudoku game Windows Forms Application with user interface having different levels of difficulites. 

There are two files: form1.cs and main.cpp. The core algorithm is illustrated in the C++ file main.cpp. The other file is the application file coded in C#, which includes the main application codes. To create the application, one still needs to build a project in Visual Studio. Create a windows form application project and run the codes. Then, an executable file with user interface will be created.
